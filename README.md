# Hey, I'm Maximiliano!
Based in <strong>Houston, Texas</strong>.

## About Me:
I'm a <strong>University of Houston</strong> student majoring in Computer Science. <em>Go Coogs!</em> Most of my current job experience has been in the education field (tutor + substitute teacher) but I also have experience working with animals due to volunteering for veterinary events in the past. In my freetime, I love creating digital illustrations and designs - so much so that I occasionally work with clients to bring their illustrative ideas to life. I also enjoy going to the gym, taking walks with my two dogs (Squeaky and Pipi), and sewing!
